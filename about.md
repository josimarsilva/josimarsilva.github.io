I am a computational geoscientist with an interest in energy and environmental problems. I received a PhD in Geophysics from MIT, where I worked with [Ruben Juanes](http://juanesgroup.mit.edu) on computational geomechanics and multiphase flow problems. Currently, I am a postdoc at  Harvard University working with [John H. Shaw](https://structure.harvard.edu) where I am investigating the impact of long-term oil production in the Los Angeles Basin on earthquake hazards.
