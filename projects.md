### Earthquake hazards and oil production in the Los Angeles Basin

The Los Angeles Basin has a long history of oil and gas production, with some oil fields producing since the beginning of the 20th century. Similarly, nearly a century of earthquake monitoring in this area have indicate an extensive occurrence of small to moderate earthquakes in the LA basin. The goal of this project is to investigate the impact of long-term oil and gas production in the LA basin on seismic hazards, specially near the major fault systems underneath the oil fields which are capable of generating large earthquakes.

### Mechanism associated with microseismicity occurrence during CO<sub>2</sub> injection

Large-scale CO<sub>2</sub> storage in geological formations is an essential climate change mitigation technology. However, it is well known that fluid injection in subsurface is capable of triggering earthquakes --- in some cases of moderate magnitudes. Therefore, it is important to understand the mechanisms that result in earthquake occurrence associated with injection activities, so as to design efficient mitigation strategies. This project seeks to investigate the mechanisms that resulted in extensive microseismicity occurrence during injection of 1 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub> in Decatur, Illinois, USA. The project outcome is a better understanding of the hydraulic and geomechanical conditions that can lead to induced seismicity associated with CO<sub>2</sub> storage in geological formations.

## Past projects

### Revisiting the classical experiment on earthquake control at Rangely, CO, using coupled multiphase flow and geomechanics

This project revisited the classical field experiment on earthquake control conducted at the Rangely oil field, CO, using coupled flow and geomechanics. In this experiment, multiple cycles of water injection and withdrawal were performed, with the associated microseismicity monitored. The original experiment was seminal to show *qualitatively* that fluid injection in subsurface can induce earthquakes. Using coupled multiphase flow and geomechanics, this project provided a mechanistic *quantitative* explanation for why and how water injection resulted in earthquake occurrence.
